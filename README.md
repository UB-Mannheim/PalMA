Summary
-------

PalMA enables people to share several contents on one monitor. Users can display PDF files, office files, images, videos, websites and or computer screens in real time (up to four entries simultaneously). Everything can be controlled via
a website, so it's perfectly usable for all kinds of (mobile) devices.

Installation
------------

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details.

Mannheim University Library develops and installs PalMA
on mini PCs running Debian GNU Linux and Raspbian (Stretch). Other Linux based hardware
and software combination can also be used, but might require some smaller
modifications.

Hardware requirements
---------------------

The team monitor (with adequate size and resolution) is connected
to a computing device (usually a mini pc) running Linux.
Hardware requirements for the pc are relatively low. For reasonable performance we recommend something at least as strong as a Raspberry Pi 3.

A minimal setup can be built with an ARM based mini pc like the
Raspberry Pi for less than 100 EUR. It can drive monitors with
HDMI and full HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixel), but is slow
and only offers limited memory for viewer applications.

A setup with good performance can be built with an Intel NUC for
around 200 EUR. It also provides HDMI and resolutions up to
1920 x 1200 pixel.

A high end setup uses a mini pc with Intel Core i5, more RAM and
a fast solid state disk (SSD). HDMI allows full HD resolution, display port (DP)
even larger resolution.

Client Software
---------------

Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X clients need additional software if users
want to share their desktop. These products were tested successfully
with desktop computers and notebooks:

* UltraVNC – http://www.uvnc.com/ (GNU General Public License)
  This is a free VNC server for Windows.
  Using the Single Click version UltraVNC SC, it is possible
  to address preconfigured displays without any installation.

* VineServer – https://www.testplant.com/osxvnc (commercial)
  This VNC server is needed for MacBooks with retina display.
  There is a free VNC server for individual private use.

* x11vnc – http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/ (free)
  This VNC server is included in most Linux distributions.

It is currently not possible to share the desktop of mobile
devices (smartphones / tablets).
